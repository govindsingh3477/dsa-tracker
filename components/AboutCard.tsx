          The DSA Tracker is a minimal platform designed to help users practice carefully selected daily problems curated by admins. 
          It focuses on providing three impactful problems daily to build a strong foundation. Over time, the problem sets will 
          increase in complexity, ensuring users are well-prepared for interviews and competitive coding. 
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          This platform works on self-volunteering and honesty, as users mark problems solved for their own benefit. 
          Future plans include evolving it into a community-driven platform with solution verification, discussions, 
          and collaborative learning opportunities.
